# Assemble

Deployed here: http://rocky-falls-68125.herokuapp.com/

## Description
Assemble is a platform for quickly organizing public events from exercise groups to protests. 

## Usage
Event organizers can log in and create events with a time, place, description, and category. 

Event participants do not have to log in and can view all currently active events or filter the list of events by time, place, or category. Participants are also able to become "Watchers" of a given event which will allow them to submit an email address to be used by the event organizer to notify them of any updates to the event. 

## Technology
MySQL - Database for storing Events, Users, and Watchers

Sequelize - ORM for MySQL

Express - Server framework

Passport - Stores user credentials

bcrypt - Encrypts users passwords before storage

Nodemailer - Sends emails

Bootstrap - Front-end framework

Heroku - Deployment and hosting
